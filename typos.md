# Typos for *Pro Angular, 5th Edition*

This file contains smaller errors that are unlikely to prevent the code examples from working and which I will correct in the next edition of the book. See [this](errata.md) file for mistakes that prevent the code examples from working as expected.

**Chapter 2**

On page 20, this sentence:

>   In this case, the data bindings tell Angular to get the value of the username and 
itemCount properties and insert them into the content of the h3 and div elements.

should be:

>   In this case, the data bindings tell Angular to get the value of the username and 
itemCount properties and insert them into the content of the h3 and **h6** elements.
